    <h1 class="head">STARTING OVER<br>LSD and the Search for God</h1>
    <p class="Lorem">When I was a young girl (when I was younger)
I knew a boy like you (you thought you knew me)
Threw my heart over a fence (well, I thought I'd make it painful)
If back then only I knew (if I only knew, I'd start it over)
there's a memory
Come back again, I'll do it over (I couldn't find you)
(Real life) you might wanna do it again
Honey, you know I'd do it over (let me remind you, real life)
Take home the miracle
Come back again, I'm gonna talk to you (I couldn't find you)
I couldn't reach you when I was trying</p>
