LUSTRE | Design Portfolio

LUSTRE is a high-end visual identity landing page designed for a graphic designer based in Bohol. It serves as a digital showroom for professional branding, print layouts, and futuristic visual systems. The project solves the problem of "boring" portfolios by using a brutalist, high-contrast aesthetic to instantly capture the attention of potential creative clients.

## AI Assistance Disclosure (Required)
*Did you use AI tools?* Yes

**Details:**
I used Gemini to help structure the custom JavaScript cursor logic (specifically the interpolation math for the lens) and to debug the specific opacity requirements for the "See More" project card. I used claude to refine my program and to structure the design I want. All the layout ideas, and styling are by me. 

## Learning Reflection (Short)
I learned how to put images and to put color backgrounds, and also how to do mouse hover effects. The most challenging part was to balance out the style of the see more card.
