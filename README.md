🔹 BEYOND Landing Page.

🔹 Description
BEYOND is a community-focused landing page for "The Visual Collective," designed to connect global visionaries in branding, print, and digital art. It serves as a promotional hub for sharing resources (like the Adobe Creative Suite) and showcasing avant-garde visual works. The project solves the problem of isolation in the creative field by offering a centralized, high-contrast digital space for collaboration and portfolio display.

🔹 Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

🔹 Features
* Featured Works Gallery: A responsive grid layout displaying poster designs and products (e.g., "Pretty Women," "Off White™ for Nike") with a clear hierarchy.
* Interactive Hover Effects: Dynamic overlays on project cards that reveal numbers and details (01–08) upon user interaction.
* Community CTA: A dedicated "Get Started" call-to-action section inviting users to join the collective and access shared tools.

🔹 AI Assistance Disclosure (Required)
Did you use AI tools? Yes

Details:
I used Gemini to help structure the custom JavaScript cursor logic (specifically the interpolation math for the lens) and to debug the specific opacity requirements for the "See More" project card. I used Claude to refine my program and to structure the design layout. All the layout ideas and styling are by me.

🔹 Learning Reflection (Short)
I learned how to effectively place images, set background colors, and implement CSS mouse hover effects to enhance user interaction. The most challenging part was balancing the style of the "See More" card to ensure it fit seamlessly with the rest of the grid.
